## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM Methodology
- CSS Animations

### Continued development

I need to develop more muscle memory in regards to building layouts. Didn't struggle with the concepts practiced here, but I still haven't developed speed over building with features such as flexbox and animations. 

Soon I intend to timebox my further solutions and work more often on these challenges.

One particular unrelated challenge I had during development, was that I had to work with an extremely slow connection and rely mostly on memory. I worked with a 0.5 Mbps internet connection

### Useful resources

- [7-1 Sass Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) - Although I didn't use SCSS in this particular challenge, I guided myself of the 7-1 architecture to organize my CSS files.
